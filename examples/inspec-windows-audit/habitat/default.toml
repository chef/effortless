# You don't usually need to change these. This project provides highly tuned
# defaults for you. If you don't have a strong reason for overriding these then
# it's a good idea to remove them.

# The number of seconds to wait between Chef InSpec runs
# Default value: 1800
interval = 1800

# A random number of seconds between 0 and `splay` to add AFTER the interval.
# Use this setting to avoid the thundering herd problem. It is recommended to
# always set this equal to the interval, or else you may end up DDOSing your
# own internal resources.
# Default value: 1800
splay = 1800

# A random number of seconds between 0 and $splay_first_run BEFORE the first
# Chef InSpec runs, only on the first run. Used to avoid the thundering herd
# problem on new deployments. Optimally you should set this to a function of
# your node count, adding 1 second for each node in your fleet. For example,
# if you have 1800 nodes, then you should set this value to 1800.
# Default value: 0
splay_first_run = 0

# The level of logging to be stored in a log file for the Chef InSpec runs.
# Possible levels: :auto (default), :debug, :info, :warn, :error, or :fatal.
# Default value: :warn (when a terminal is available) or :info.
log_level = "warn"

# The connection information for your Chef Automate server/
# Options:
#  - enable: Set to `true` to enable, `false` to disable (Default: false)
#  - server_url: Chef Automate server URL (Default: 'https://<automate_url>')
#  - token: API token for Chef Automate (Default: '<automate_token>')
#  - user: User for requests to Chef Automate (Default: '<automate_user>')
