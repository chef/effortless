# Welcome to the Chef Effortless Patterns

The Effortless Pattern is a way to better manage Chef Infra and Chef InSpec workloads using Chef Habitat and visualizing your fleet using Chef Automate. We believe that each of these technologies working together can help you better manage your infrastructure.

## Purpose
The purpose of the Effortless pattern is to reduce the amount of code and Chef knowledge a user needs in order to be successful with Chef products.
